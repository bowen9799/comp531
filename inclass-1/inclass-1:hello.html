        <h1>Bowen Liu's Page</h1>
        <p>My technical interests: I am very enthusiastic about algorithms, and am especially good at those in machine learning.
            During my internship in summer 2016 at <a href="http://www.fujitsu.com/global/">Fujitsu</a> Corp., I wrote in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> more than 10 demos 
            for algorithms of both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering, because I was 
            highly interested in the mechanisms behind. Further, I optimized the performance of the 
            demos by adjusting the variables in those ML algorithms, based on their performance in 
            clustering/classifying Japanese FAQ pairs. During this period, I experimentally used many 
            Python ML libraries, such as <a href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>, <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a>, Orange, etc., and worked with NLTK and 
            Orange intensively. In fact, my interests and initiatives in ML eventually made me the 
            coordinator of the other two interns in my group.</p>
        <p>My favorite sport is basketball. I ball almost everyday:</p>
