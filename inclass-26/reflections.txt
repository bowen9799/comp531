This course covers everything I wanted to know before I took it. I worked well on this course for the first four assignments, but later it was a bit too fast for me. I think more time could be spent in class on the react and redux so that we can spend less time struggling after class. I think the overall course design is pretty good. Thank you for a great semester!
