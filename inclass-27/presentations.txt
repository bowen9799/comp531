1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
react native
    The speaker clearly defined react native for developing native mobile app; he also tapped on the pros of react native:
     	one language for all
        bridge with native code
        fast development
    and that products like slack, instagram are using it, which made me realize how important this framework is.
2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
native app vs web app. I learnt:
    native app 
        cons:
            hard to test and develop
            develop one app for one platform
        pros:
            better performance
    web app:
        cons:
	    easy to develop
	    cross-platform
        pros:
	    performs badly compared to native app
    hybrid: 
        pros:
            cross-platform
            have access to native API
3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
Google Adwords: The speaker talked about the formula for paying ads: ad rank / quality score (ad rank = max bid * quality score), which is very interesting to me. He also tapped on behavioral ads and compromise of ads which were also fun to listen to.
